## Reading Input

This example demonstrates how to read the value from an `<input>` element.

### The block
- **`get the [text] value of input with id [<id value>]`**
  - It reads the value from an `<input>` element identified by the attribute `id="<id value>"`.
  - `text` means the value is treated as a string (instead of as a number).
    
### What does this blockly program do?

Whenever a user clicks the "GREET" button, the program reads the value 
from the `<input>` element and shows the value as the text content of 
`<span id="nameOutput">`.
