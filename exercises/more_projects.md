## More projects 

Here are some additional ideas of projects that can be accomplished with the current blocks (some newer blocks haven't been properly introduced yet). They all fit generally into the "add some button or event handlers that add or modify some html" category.

### Shopping list

Create a list of products.
Display each product in an html list with a "add to shopping cart" button next to it.
When the button is clicked, add the product to a separate html list that represents the current shopping cart.

### List with a hidden 2nd

Create an html list with a second list inside each `li` (maybe a list of folders and the files in each folder ?)
Hide the inner lists.
Clicking the first level item toggles the visibility of the inner list (if it's hidden, show it, if it's visible, hide it)

### Hamburger

Can be vaguely inspired by e.g. https://dev.to/devggaurav/let-s-build-a-responsive-navbar-and-hamburger-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript-
Display an `ul` of nav links as a "closed" hamburger
Clicking on the hamburger makes the `ul` visible
Clicking on the hamburger transforms the hamburger into an X
Clicking on the X makes the `ul` invisible (and shows the hamburger)
Clicking on any link makes the `ul` invisible (and shows the hamburger)

### Create a check list

Display a list of todo items.
When each item is clicked, mark it in some way (strike through, invisible).
Note: this is basically a variant of the shopping cart.

### Create a todo list

Display an input and an "add todo" button (currently the input and means of accessing the input don't exist, so would have to add some blocks).
When the "add todo" is clicked, add the item to an html list.
Stretch goal: combine with the exercise above.
