# Introduction - part 1

## Course overview 

In this course, you will use _block-based programming_ to solve a series of exercises. You will use code blocks to generate Javascript code that can interact with a html page to solve each task. The way the blocks work ( and the code they generate ) is very like the code you will learn in the long course. There are also some differences that make the code easier for new learners.

The goal is to use the generated code in your own project. You will copy paste this code into a single javascript file and add it, with html and css, to your course project. 


Head over to the next section for more info on how the exercises work.
