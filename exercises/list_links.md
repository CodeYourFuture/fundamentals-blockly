## Lists of links

In this exercise, we're going to consolidate our knowledge of the blocks we've learnt so far.


Start with an empty unordered html list in the static html:

```html
<ul id="list">
</ul>
```

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to write a blockly program that will update the rendered html. We won't actually update the static html area. When our blockly program runs, it will then update the rendered html.


1. Find the URLs of your three favourite websites. (Here's an example of a url you might like: ```html http://www.codeyourfuture.io``` ðŸ˜Š)
2. Use the blocks we have seen so far (`at the start`, `find the element with id`, `create a new ... element`, `set the attribute`, `set the text content`, and the Values blocks)


### Hints

- You will need to create an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> inside of each <code>&lt;li&gt;</code></li>
- Remember that to set the target of an `<a>` element you can use the `href` attribute. Without this attribute, your link won't work and it won't have the correct style.
- How could you break your solution down into small chunks that you can test at each stage by clicking `run` ? The fewer code blocks you add before clicking `run` the easier it is to work out what your code will do. 

<span class="test-checkbox"></span>Click `run` to check the output looks something like

<ul style="background-color: azure;">
  <li><a href="http://www.codeyourfuture.io">Code your future</a></li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk">BBC News</a></li>
</ul>
