## Button consolidation


In earlier exercises, our blockly program executed after we clicked the run button. We can also write blockly programs that will run in response to some kind of user interaction. For example, we can write a program that executes after a user clicks on a particular button.


We're going to start with a madlibs sentence but this time with `<button>` elements around some of the mad lib words. (It 's the same mad libs sentence from the first exercise.)

```html
<p>The <button id="noun1">dog</button>
<button id="verb">saw</button> the 
<button id="adjective">white</button> 
<button id="noun2">cat</button></p>
```

### Exercise 1

1. <span class="test-checkbox"></span>Make it so each button's text gets set to a random word when a user clicks on it.


2. <span class="test-checkbox"></span>Place two buttons with text (`day mode` and `night mode`) in the static HTML. Then add an unordered list to the static HTML too. Add some blocks so that when a user clicks on one of the 2 buttons, the HTML list changes to "day mode" / "night mode".

> ðŸŒž "Day mode" should be dark text on a light background. <br>
> ðŸŒ™ "Night mode" should be light text on a dark background.

### Exercise 2

1. <span class="test-checkbox"></span>Place another button in the static html. Can you add blocks so it changes colour when a user clicks on it?

### Exercise 3


1. <span class="test-checkbox"></span>Place an image in the static html. Can you add blocks so it changes when a user clicks on it ?
