## Building an image carousel

An image carousel has an image with two buttons ("previous" and "next") that allow the user to cycle through a list of images.

A list of at least 3 image URLs should be defined in an array. (You can use public URLs from stock photograph websites, or copy the image link from a google search result.)

Your project have the following features:

- Clicking on the "previous" button should show the previous image
- Clicking on the "next" button should show the next image
- The images should cycle (The next image after the last image should be the first image. Similarly, the previous image before the first image should be the last image.)

You should first break down this problem into steps, then outline how you will probably solve each step.
You should also think about how you can test what you think each step does, before you start using any blocks.
