# Introduction - part 2

In this course, you will use _block-based programming_, like on code.org, to create JavaScript that changes the html on a web page.

## Prerequisites

These exercises assume you have tried block based programming already. Do the [code.org course](https://studio.code.org/s/course3) before you start. 
You should at least have done the lessons up to Conditionals and While Loops.

## Understanding the exercises - rendering HTML

- You can write html in the text area above.
- Try writing a `p` element in the text area above that contains the text `hello world!`
- Try clicking the "run" button to **render** the html element in the area below.

> ⚙️ **render** means take the html code and interpret in order to produce a web page. All modern browsers work by interpreting a html document and converting into a web page

- You can use blocks to create code that changes the html.  
- Click "run" to render the html in the space below the text area and execute the generated code.
- Unlike code.org, in CYF Blocks you can go to the next exercise when you feel ready.
  - Grey checkmarks show that your current code doesn't solve the instruction.
  - Green checkmarks show that it solves the task
  - The blocks create JavaScript code. You can view the result in the "Generated code" textarea. You are not expected to understand this code yet. (It's interesting to look at, though!)
