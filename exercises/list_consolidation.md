## List of links


Repeat the exercise to show a list of your favourite links.
Use a loop so that there are only two `create a ... element` blocks (one for the `<li>`, one for the `<a>`).
Outline what your solution needs to look like, and implement it step by step.
Remember to click "run" at each iteration to check your work.
