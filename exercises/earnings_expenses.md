## Showing earnings and expenses

For this project, you should provide the user with the ability to input earnings and expenses and see the totals.


In this project, we define earnings and expenses as below:

ℹ️ A positive number is an **earning**</br>
ℹ️ A negative number is an **expense**

Your project should do the following things:

- display a list of all the earnings and a total of all earnings
- display a list of all the expenses and a total of all expenses
- display the total overall balance

In this project, users should be able to add an earning/expense one at a time. The project should provide an input box where users can enter an earning/expense. They should then be able to press a button to add their inputted earning/expense to the user interface.

For example, if the user inputs 5, -2, 25, -10, -7, the result should look something like: 


<div style="background-color: azure;">
  Earnings: 30
  <ul>
  <li>5</li>
  <li>25</li>
    </ul>
    Expenses: -19
    <ul>
      <li>-2</li>
      <li>-10</li>
      <li>-3</li>
  </ul>
    Balance: 11
</div>

You should make use of the `get numerical value` block for this project.
