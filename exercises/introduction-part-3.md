# Introduction - part 3

In this course, you will use _block-based programming_, like on code.org, to create JavaScript that changes the html on a web page.


## Understanding the exercises - interacting with the html page.


We saw on the previous page, we can write html code and then click run to generate a web page. However, we also want to interact with this web page. This means we want to update, add or remove html elements from the page. 
We are going to use Code Blocks to interfact with the web page.   


- You can use blocks to create code that changes the html.
- You should notice the block in the page on the right sand side. Try working out what this block will do to the web page.  
- Click "run" to render the html in the space below the text area **and** execute the generated code.

## Checking your progress

- Grey checkmarks show that your current code doesn't solve the instruction.
- Green checkmarks show that it solves the task
- The blocks create JavaScript code. You can view the result in the "Generated code" textarea.
 You are not expected to understand this code yet. (It's interesting to look at, though!)
